function m = varx(Y,na,X,nb,lambda)

% model = varx(Y,na,X,nb,lambda) fits an vectorial ARX model to the MIMO
% system output Y with input X by minimizing the equation error e(t), i.e.
% equation error model:
%
% Y(t) = A*Y(t-1) + B*X(t) + e(t)
%
% where * represents a convolution.  The model cotrains the following
% variables, stored as stucture elements:
% 
% model = A, B, A_pval, B_pval, A_Deviance,B_Deviance, T
% 
% A and B are filter model parameters found with conventional least squares
% with ridge regression. They are stored as tensor of size [na,ydim,ydim]
% and [nb,ydim,xdim] respectively. na and nb are the legth of the filters.
% lambda is the regularization for the ridge (shrinkage) regularization and
% defaults to 0 and should not be selected larger than 1. Note that x(t)
% represents the history including the current sample in the input. Thus,
% we are allowing for instant effects. This is the norm in the signal
% processing literature but no in the Granger Causality VAR models,
% although there is no theoretical reason not to include instant effect in
% the external input. To avoid instant effects, the user can simply delay
% the input by one sample.
% 
% A_pval,B_pval are  P-values for each channel (for all delays together)
% using the Deviance formalism.
%
% A_Deviance, B_Deviance ,T are Deviance and number of sample used in the
% estimation of p-values, and Deviance/T can serve as a measure of effect
% size, and can be used to compute generalized R-square: R2 = 1 -
% exp(-Devinace/T).
%
% varx(Y,na,X,base,lambda) If base is not a scalar, it is assumed that it
% represent basis functions for filters B of size [filter length, number of
% basis functions]. B will have size [size(base,2),ydim,xdim], i.e. as many
% parameers for each path as basis functions. The actual filters can be
% obtained as tensorprod(base,B,2,1);
%
% varx(Y,na,X,nb,lambda) If Y is a cell array, then the model is fit on all
% data records in X and Y. All elements in the cell arrays X and Y have to
% have the same xdim and ydim, but may have different numer of rows (time
% samples).
%
% varx(Y,na) Only fitst the AR portion. To provide lambda, set set x=[] and
% nb=0.
% 
% If the intention is to only fit a MA model, then the Granger formalism
% requires at least an AR portion for each output channel, without the
% interaction between ouput channels. If that is the intention, then one
% should call this function for each output channel separatelly, e.g.
% varx(y(:,i),na,x,nb)
%
% model can be used by varx_display(model) for display. 

% (c) July 10, 2023 Lucas C Parra
%     07/11/2023 put duplicade code into model_fit function
%     08/01/2023 transposed A, B to match varx_filter.m and varm.m, 
%     08/02/2023 corrected scaling of Bias term. 
%     08/06/2023 scalling gamma=lambda/(T-sum(lags)) for correct pvalue for large T
%     08/09/2023 error computed using Rxx, Rxy, h, and scaled LLR with T-sum(lags)+lags(i) for correct pvalues for small T and unequal lags
%     08/10/2023 moved computation of yest to varx_simulate()
%     08/16/2023 converted format of A,B to 3D tensor
%     08/18/2023 added basis functions
%     08/20/2023 removed the need to pass x,y to fit_model to save memory; added option to operate on multiple datarecords
%     08/23/2023 allow for AR portion of the model only
%     08/31/2023 changed input history to include current sample x(t) as predictor
%     09/01/2023 ignore x argument for nb=0 
%     09/11/2023 changed the order of input arguments
%     regularization range be between 0-1 with increasing T (based on
%     simulaitons)
%     12/10/2023 computation of y power now inside myxcorr() to allow removal of NaN
%     12/12/2023 determine T inside myxcorr() to account for data actually used in the fit. 
%     01/09/2024 returns D and T, with D/T as a rough measure of effect size
%     04/03/2024 Changed to Tikhonov regularization so that all variables have same regularization regardless of power. pvalues otherwise not correct when power very different after applying basis functions 
%     04/11/2024 Changed output to model structure to work with varx_display, output was getting too complicated.    
%     05/16/2024 Aimar, changed so the model no computes the A and B Rvalues inside the main varx script
